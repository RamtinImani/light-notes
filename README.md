## 🎯 Goal of the Project

The main purpose of building **Light Notes** was to strengthen my understanding of core React concepts and best practices.  
This project allowed me to experiment with and apply the following:  

- ⚡ **React Custom Hooks** – Creating reusable logic across components.  
- 🧩 **State Management** – Practicing with `useState`, `useReducer`, and combining them with `useContext`.  
- 🔗 **Context + Reducer Pattern** – Implementing a scalable way to manage global state.  
- 🎛️ **Event Handling** – Gaining experience in handling user interactions in React.  
- 🛠️ **Practical Experience** – Applying theoretical knowledge in a real-world project.  

This app wasn’t just about building a notes tool — it was a way to **practice, learn, and improve my React skills** while creating something useful.
